# SkiFree.js - Minimalist Edition

This is a modified version of the JavaScript port of the popular 1991 PC game [SkiFree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skifree) by [Chris Pirih](http://ski.ihoc.net/).

## About This Version

This minimalist edition of SkiFree.js focuses on providing a clean, distraction-free gaming experience with:

* A simplified UI with no text overlays or information boxes
* Enhanced start screen with more visual elements (trees, snowboarders, jumps, and rocks)
* Increased spawn rates for snowboarders and other game elements
* Preserved core gameplay mechanics from the original

## How to Play

* Open index.html in a modern browser
* Click the "Start Game" button or press any key to begin
* Use arrow keys to control the skier
* Press F for a speed boost (useful to escape monsters!)
* Mobile support: use your finger to direct the skier and double-tap for speed boost

## Features

* Endless skiing down a procedurally generated slope
* Collision detection with obstacles
* Monsters that chase and eat you
* Rainbow jump platforms & jumping mechanics
* Mobile touch controls
* LocalStorage high-score tracking (though score display is hidden)
* Various obstacles including trees, rocks, and jumps
* Snowboarders and other skiers on the slopes
